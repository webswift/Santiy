                        <img src="assets/images/welcome_img.png" align="right">

                        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                      <p>Thank you for choosing Sanity OS as your lead management system. To help you to get the most out of your this handy piece of software below is a beginners guide to getting started which includes videos guides and examples with images. If you need any further help you'll be able to find the contact details for support here too.</p>
                      <p><strong><br>
                        Step 1, Creating Forms:<br>
                        </strong>Before you start a campaign or import data you should create a customised Lead form. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Step  2, Create an Email template:<br>
                        </strong>Have you ever been on a call to a prospect and asked for more information? Sanity OS lets you create and store email templates for such occasions so when you're on a call in the SOS environment you can select the template and send it straight to a customer without leaving the screen.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Step 3, Create a campaign:<br>
                        </strong>Before you can start calling customers and recording data you need to create a campaign. Campaigns can be named after a product you're promoting, a service or an entire business. When you create a campaign you can import contacts or leads in to the database or choose to type them as you go along.<br>
                         <br>
                        <strong>Step 4, Ready to Go!:<br>
                        </strong>You've now completed most of the things you need to start using Sanity OS. When you want to want to begin calling people from your campaign select <strong>start call manager</strong> and click the applicable campaign.</p>

                        <p>To ensure the most optimal delivery rates and to avoid your email's ending up in spam folders.
Sanity OS Provides you with two methods:</p>
                        <ol><li><strong>The way that everyone else does it
                          </strong><br>Let our mail servers send your emails, a lot of software services do this including mailchimp, constant contact and even most lead management solutions. 
Your account is setup this way by default and the reply to address will always be the one registered to your account registered with Sanity OS.
</li><br>
<strong><li>Recommended settings</li></strong>Do you want to ensure optimal delivery rates? Do you have your own website and domain? If so, the chances are you have access to your own SMTP settings.
Your hosting provider should easily be able to provide you with your SMTP settings. Once you obtain this information you can use your own mail server to send guaranteed email's through Sanity OS just like you would on your phone or using an email client like Outlook. 
                        </ol>
                        To use your own mail server in Sanity OS Click "<strong>Settings</strong>" from the menu then select "<strong>Manage your account</strong>". 

You will see a button that say's "<strong>Edit email settings</strong>". Click the button to reveal the settings window (as displayed below):<br>
<img src="http://www.sanityos.com/imgsupport/email_settings.png"><br>
Enter your SMTP details and use the "verify" button to test the settings are correct. 
<p><strong>All Done!</strong>

                        You can now be assured that emails will be delivered to your customers as if they were sent from your own mailbox.

                      <h2 id="lead-forms">Lead Forms (Updated!)</h2>
                      <p>Sanity OS allows you to build custom forms to match your call/campaign criteria needs. To put it simply any data you  import or record when talking to prospects should be on this form. Examples of this are <strong>First Name, Last Name, Website, Email </strong>and so on... <br>
                      </p>
                      <p><strong>To build a form follow these simple steps: </strong><br>
                        <strong><br>
                        </strong>1. From the main menu select<strong> Campaign Manager</strong><br>
                        <strong><br>
                        </strong>2. Select <strong>Manage Lead Forms</strong><br>
                        <strong><br>
                      </strong>3. The options on the Left (highlighted in red below) are a choice of fields for you to use in your form. As each option is selected you will notice its added to a box on the right.</p>
<p><img src="http://sanityos.com/imgsupport/form.jpg"></p>
<p>4. If you want to add a custom field or  even a drop menu with multiple options simply click "Add New Field".<br>
  <br>
5. You can drag the columns in order of priority using the box to the right. The height you place them in will be the order the options appear on your actual form.<br>
<img src="http://sanityos.com/imgsupport/drag.jpg"><br>
6. Give your form a name<br>
<br>
7. Click Preview to see what your form will look like or simply press save to continue<br>
<br>
8.  You will notice a checkbox besides the 'X'/delete button when you add a new field. Ticking the checkbox enables validation of that field. This means when its enabled the user will need to  complete it before they can load another lead.

                        <h2 id="email-templates">More Info Email Templates<img src="http://sanityos.com/img_features/send_emails.png" height="90"></h2>
                        <p>Email templates are an easy way of getting your message across to a customer when they ask for it. During important calls to prospects agents are always asked to "send more information".
                        </p>
                        <p>Rather than minimizing  windows, opening up other email services and typing a new email to their prospect there is now a much easier way!Sanity OS allows you to send emails in one simple environment. It's easy! Pre-draft an email for your agents to use so they can seamlessly send information on demand during calls. <strong>Lets Learn How:</strong><br>
                        </p>
                      
                        <p><strong>Step 1, Click Marketing tools in the menu, then select More Info Emails</strong><br>
                          <strong><br>
                          Step 2, Select "Create new"<br>
                          </strong>Give your email template a name so you OR your agents can quickly identify it. <br>
                          <strong><br>
                          Step 3, Create the email<br>
                          </strong>Give your email a subject and write the content of the message in the provided body section.<br>
                          You can import images and add attachments to send with the email such as brochures or whitepapers. <br>
                          <strong><br>
                          Step 4, Address the email (Optional)<br>
                          </strong>Sanity OS allows you to address the email when its sent to the prospect by using the "form fields".  So when the template is selected and sent it will be addressed to the person your agent is speaking to.

                      <p>The idea of creating a campaign can vary for business to business. A typical scenario would be to create a campaign in order to upload Data you have obtained so that your agents can ring around and warm up prospects. Some organisations import their contacts and use the campaign to contact them about new products or services whereas some may name a campaign after a particular client they may be working on behalf of. In order to begin using Sanity OS you must create a campaign, if you don't have data or contacts to import don't worry you can do that later and create a "Fly Campaign".

                            </strong><br>
                            <strong>Step 2, Give your campaign a name<br>
                            </strong>Name your campaign and if you're a multi license user you can choose which members in your team can access the campaign. <br>
                            <strong><br>
                            Step 3, Select a form that is applicable to your campaign.<br>
                            </strong>This will be the form you designed previously. If you haven't made one you can use the Default Form.<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Step 4, Auto-generate Reference numbers<br>
                            </strong>Reference numbers are complete optional but if you'd like to use them then Sanity OS can create them for you. You can also add a prefix to each reference number like an abbreviation of your company name. <br>
                            <strong><br>
                            Step 5, Press Next and import your leads!<br>
                            </strong>You can import leads very easily using a CSV file or by copying and pasting from Excel in to the body provided. <br>
                            <br>
                            "<strong>BUT WAIT... I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO IMPORT?</strong>"<strong> </strong>No problems, select "I don't Have either of the above". <strong>Click Next.</strong> <br>
                            <strong><br>
                            You're all done! and ready to start making your calls. <br>
                            </strong>Sanity OS will show you an overview of the data imported and remove any duplicates. <br>
                            Then Click the <strong>Start call manager button</strong> from the Lead Management menu to begin. </p>
