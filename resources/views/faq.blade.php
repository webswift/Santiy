                                     Sanityos.com is a software as a service (SAAS) sales and lead management application. It's been developed to record contact with customers, book sales appointments and lots more. Sanityos is different from other CRM's because it doesn't get involved in every area of your business such as finances, hiring or firing. It's simply the most ideal tool for you or a team to import prospects in to and begin making and measuring calls using feature rich tools that are accessible within our smart interface.  <br>
<br>Sanityos.com doesn't require users to own servers, or high powered pc's to run it. All the resources required to efficiently run our software is hosted in the cloud.                                  </div>

                                     Ever been on a call, warmed up a lead and then asked to send more information? Sanityos.com allows you to store an unlimited amount of pre-drafted emails and send them to the customer within the lead generator. So, the very moment you are asked for more information you can select the pre-drafted email and send it immediately without leaving the screen. You can also write emails to the customer too. <br><br>
Another cool feature is that SanityOS gives you the option of using our server to send emails or lets you add your own outgoing mail server.

Each time an appointment is booked with a member of your sales team the lead information and discussion trail will be emailed to them in a PDF. <br><br>
SanityOS doesn't provide a "salesman" login functionality. We know that almost every organisation handles the post appointment booking phase of sales using their own practises and methodology therefore we provide them with all the information they require via email each time an appointment is booked.
